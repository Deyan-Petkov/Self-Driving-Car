# Self-Driving-Car

* This piece of code will navigate your Arduino car kit (using the signals of the infrared sensor).
* The configuration is for following a black line (e.g. electrical tape).
Different sizes of tape will affect the behaviour (For best results use 18mm tape)
* The car should be able to behave correctly on straight, zig-zag, curved and broken (straight) line.
